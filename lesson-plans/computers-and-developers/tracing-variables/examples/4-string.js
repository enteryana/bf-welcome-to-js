/* Strings

  1- strings are a data type used to work with text in programs

  2- in JS, a string is anything wrapped in quotation marks

  3- There is no difference between single quote ' ' or double quote " "
  in JS, but if you start with ' you must end the string with '
  same for double quote " "

  4- Template literals:
  - allow creating multiline strings.
  - allow string interpolation
